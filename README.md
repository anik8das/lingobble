# Lingobble

Tired of googling words only to revisit them on a regular basis and waiting forever to have them implanted in your permanent vocabulary? Let Lingobble help you out!

Every time you google a word, Lingobble saves it and tests you on it in a spaced repetition manner: 1 day, 7 days, 16 days, 35 days. If all the stages are passed, the word is as good as implanted in your permanent memory. If any of the stages are failed, the word goes back to the first one.
